To crush a monster and work til dawn, or to go to bed. The age-old question. I choose to go to bed, precisely because it's what I dont want to do. Is it worth sacrificing tomorrow's productivity for the illusion of productivity tonight? No. I choose to go to bed.

Previously, I'd have chosen to stay up. The self-sabotage disguised as sacrifice: the enticing, sexy, cinematic sigma montage. But it does not solve the issue at the core. I’ve not yet optimized my days enough to  justify sacrificing sleep. It might be sexy, but I’m not there yet. I will know when it is necessary. For now, it reinforces the bad habit, inflates my ego, and ruins my circadian. So, I choose to go to bed.

I have a lot to do tomorrow. I will get it done. I will be productive. I will be focused. I will be disciplined. I will be successful. I will write the best personal statement to ever glaze the eyeballs of those admissions officers. I will get a 170 on the LSAT. My reasoning is too logical, my reading too comprehensive. I will get into law school. I will be a lawyer. I will be a great lawyer. I will develop my software. I will be a great developer.
