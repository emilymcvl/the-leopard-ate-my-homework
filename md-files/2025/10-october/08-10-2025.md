Today is the first day. First day of what? Of this. Of writing. Everyday.

Shalln’t write too much. Don’t want to get too ahead of myself.

Today, someone told me that their friend broke both his elbows. It was in response to my explaining how I once very skilfully and impressively broke both of my feet simultaneously. Weird thing to get competitive about, but okay.

I asked how he did it. My opponent responded, “He’s a raft guy”. I heard “He's a rap god” and thought she meant he broke his elbows from too much sick DJing. I was wrong.
