And the snow was falling thick and fast, through Sheffield city center. There was palm tree debris everywhere, and a Roman colosseum. Isn’t it boring when I talk about my dreams.
There are palm trees and ancient ruins. It’s always snowing there, which makes it feel surreal. It might symbolize a clash between my familiar environment and my desires for adventure or change. The snow could symbolize purity or a fresh start, while the palm trees and ruins might evoke exoticism and history. Overall, it feels like my subconscious is trying to process conflicting emotions or aspirations.Perhaps my mind is trying to reconcile these opposing desires, leading to the vivid imagery in my dreams.

I cried when I accepted my offer to law school. I was apprehensive. This has been everything I've worked for up until this point. And all of a sudden, its here. I accepted the offer. And then ate my bagel. It didn't magically fix all of my problems. The person I thought I would be in law school didn't magically appear. I am still me. With all my flaws and anxieties. And moving to Toronto doesn't mean im a new person. It means im the same person, in Toronto.Wait, stop that. You can do it now. More dry, more Richard Ayode. Simple, distill it down to its purest form. Now is the time to decide. That I am her. I can be her now, even as im sat here writing in my childhood bedroom with my hood up and a mug that reminds me of my dad that I’d rather not be drinking out of. 

I can choose now.
